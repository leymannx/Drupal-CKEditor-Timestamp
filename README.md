# Drupal CKEditor CSS and JS Timestamp Module

Small Drupal module to solve CKEditor's cache issue by refreshing its timestamp that is added as query to every CSS and JS on page reload

Download, enable, refresh your page and see how the timestamp is queried to your CKEditor files to finally load your updated files during development.
